					During a heavy rainstorm in Derry, Maine, six-year-old George "Georgie" Denbrough is chasing a paper boat down a gutter. The boat is washed down a storm drain to the dismay of Georgie, who had received the boat as a gift from his older brother Bill. Peering into the drain, Georgie sees a pair of glowing yellow eyes. Startled, Georgie is suddenly confronted by a man dressed in a silver clown suit who introduces himself as "Mr. Bob Gray," a.k.a. "Pennywise the Dancing Clown." Pennywise offers Georgie a balloon which he cautiously refuses; however, the clown entices Georgie to reach into the drain to retrieve his boat and then rips his arm off, leaving the boy in the gutter to bleed to death.

			The following June, Ben Hanscom, an overweight eleven year old boy, is harassed by a gang of bullies led by Henry Bowers. On the last day of school, Hanscom hides from his tormentors in the Barrens, where he befriends Eddie Kaspbrak, a hypochondriac boy who believes he has asthma, and "Stuttering Bill" Denbrough, George's elder brother who suffers from a stutter and rides on a rusty bike named "Silver." The three boys later befriend fellow misfits Richie Tozier, Stanley Uris and Beverly Marsh, who eventually refer to themselves as "The Losers Club." As the summer draws on, the Losers realize that they have each had an encounter with a seemingly omniscient, interdimensional shapeshifting demonic entity that takes the form of whatever they fear the most: Ben as a mummy; Eddie as a leper; Bill as George's ghost; Richie as a werewolf; Stan as two drowned boys and Beverly as a fountain of blood spurting from her bathroom sink. Due to the unknown origin of the monster, the Losers refer to the creature as "It" and link It with a series of recent child murders, including that of Edward "Eddie" Corcoran who is killed by the monster in the form of the Gill-man. Meanwhile, an increasingly unhinged and sadistic Henry Bowers begins focusing his attention on his ethnic neighbor, Mike Hanlon and his father. Henry kills Mike's dog and chases the terrified boy into the Barrens, where he befriends the other Losers. Mike tells the Losers that he was attacked by It in the form of a flesh-eating bird and they realise through Mike's picture book that It has been around for hundreds of years. The Losers begin to suspect that It has control over Derry due to the number of unsolved disappearances and violent tragedies that go unnoticed or seem forgotten by the adults in the town. One afternoon towards the end of summer Henry and his gang initiate a rock fight with the Losers in the Barrens. The bullies are left defeated and embarrassed; an injured Henry swears revenge on the Losers before departing. After further encounters of It in the form of Pennywise and various other manifestations, the Losers construct a makeshift American-Indian smokehole which Richie and Mike use to hallucinate It's origins. In doing so they discover that It came to Derry millions of years before in an asteroid-like impact and that every 27 years It awakens from a slumber underneath the town's sewers, usually after some kind of terrible event or tragedy, to feed on children for a period of 12–16 months.

					The kids return to the house on Neibolt Street where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It and It attacks them in the form of a werewolf. Beverly shoots a slug from Bill's slingshot at the werewolf, injuring It, and causing It to flee back to the sewers. It, now seeing the Losers as a threat, manipulates the mind of Henry Bowers, making him kill his violent alcoholic father and providing him with a switchblade. Henry and his two closest friends, Victor "Vic" Criss and Reginald "Belch" Huggins, follow the Losers into the sewers with the intention of killing them; however, It attacks the three bullies in the form of Frankenstein's monster, ripping Vic's head off and mutilating Belch's face. Henry, driven insane, chases the Losers and gets lost. He eventually washes out of the sewers into a nearby river and is blamed for all of the child murders. Meanwhile, Bill discovers the "Ritual Of Chüd," an ancient ritual that allows him to enter the Macroverse to confront It. During the ritual Bill encounters Mataurin, an ancient dweller and the creator of the universe who explains that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills. Bill enters the monster's mind through the Ritual of Chüd and discovers that It's true form is a mass of destructive orange lights which It refers to as the "Deadlights". With the help of Mataurin, Bill is able to defeat It and send it back to its slumber. After the battle, the Losers get lost in the sewers until Beverly has sex with all the boys to bring unity back to the group. The Losers then swear a blood oath to return to Derry should It return in the future.
