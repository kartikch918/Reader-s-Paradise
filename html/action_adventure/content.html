                    On the morning of their fifth anniversary, Nick Dunne's wife, Amy, disappears from their North
                    Carthage, Missouri home.
                    A few years before, they moved there from New York to take care of Nick's mother, who was dying of
                    cancer.
                    Amy, a New Yorker by birth, wasn't too thrilled about this and even felt that she was being taken
                    there against her will.
                    Their marriage hasn't exactly been an all-American love story, but as tough as things have been,
                    it's about to get worse.
                    By the end of the day, cops and news crews have invaded Nick's house, detectives have grilled Nick
                    into exhaustion,
                    and Amy's helicopter parents have swept in from New York to facilitate the search.
                    As the days pass with no sign of Amy—other than the clues for her annual anniversary treasure
                    hunt—the case's widespread media attention and the general public's
                    outrage place the police under extreme pressure to find a suspect.
                    Unfortunately for Nick, they're closing in on him. Because he's our main character, we want to
                    believe Nick didn't do it.
                    In spite of this, the mounting evidence against him,
                    especially his ongoing affair with a much younger woman and the details he withholds about the
                    morning Amy disappeared, can't be ignored.

                <div class="col-md-8 para">
                    The one reasonable doubt comes from the treasure hunt, a trail of clues that lead Nick
                    to important places in their relationship before finally arriving at his anniversary
                    present. In spite of their ongoing marital problems, Nick finds himself falling in love with
                    Amy as he reads the love notes she leaves at each location, feeling wooed back to her
                    although it seems too late. The investigation of her disappearance isn't the only thread
                    in this story, however. Part One is also punctuated with excerpts from Amy's personal
                    diary, giving us a glimpse of her witty—but high-strung—only child personality.
                    Through these entries, Amy reveals how her and Nick's seemingly charmed romance began to
                    deteriorate. While they were once magazine writers in New York, both lost their jobs
                    before the allegedly temporary move to Missouri.
                    In spite of Amy's objections, though, they seem to be stuck there permanently,
                    even after his mother's death. Nick has opened a bar with his twin sister, gotten a
                    job at the community college, and is growing distant, possessive, and violent.
                    Amy's diary reveals a woman who is never sure where she stands with her husband and is
                    scared enough to try to buy a gun.

                    Back in the present day, the evidence against Nick continues to pile.
                    The cops find traces of massive blood loss on the kitchen floor, stacks of maxed out credit card
                    bills,
                    and discrepancies that make the scene in the living room look staged. As the investigation turns
                    against
                    him, Nick continues to deny that he had any involvement with Amy's disappearance, while
                    simultaneously
                    trying to keep the secret of his affair from getting out. Nick realizes he's in big trouble,
                    though,
                    when the treasure hunt leads to the woodshed behind his sister's house—which is packed to the hilt
                    with
                    the golf clubs and electronics from the credit card bills. Oops. Hold the phone a minute, though.
                    Amy's got a big surprise for us: She's still alive, hiding out at a cabin in the Ozarks after
                    framing
                    Nick for murder—oh, and she's totally psycho. The whole scene back in North Carthage is of her own
                    invention, including the credit card purchases, the blood on the kitchen floor (don't even ask),
                    and
                    even a gullible neighbor who's broken the news to the cops that Amy's pregnant (not really).
                    She plans to hide out until she runs out of money, then drown herself and let her body wash to the
                    Gulf
                    of Mexico to be discovered. This plan is foiled, though, when some neighbors at the cabin complex
                    rob her,
                    leaving her penniless. Ha.
